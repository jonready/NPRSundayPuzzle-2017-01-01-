# The Puzzle this Solves:
[FROM SUNDAY PUZZLE ON 2017-01-01:](http://www.npr.org/2017/01/01/507567187/for-this-puzzling-retrospective-on-2016-youll-need-a-set-of-speakers)Take the four-letter men's names TODD, OMAR, DAVE and DREW. If you write them one under the other, they'll form a word square, spelling TODD, OMAR, DAVE and DREW reading down as well:

TODD,
OMAR,
DAVE,
DREW

Can you construct a word square consisting of five five-letter men's names? Any such square using relatively familiar men's names will count. I have an answer using four relatively common names and one less familiar one.
